# ALTimes

### A simple tool for the game Azur Lane that helps you keep track of your commissions, class room etc. so that you can  optimize your time usage.

### Built using React.js, your data is saved locally so you don't have to worry about losing your timers if you accidentally (or not) close your browser or the tab.

### Project aims to be developed further, adding new or correcting existing features.
